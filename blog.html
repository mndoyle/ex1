            <h3>Evaluating Pinterest | 1.19.2016</h3>
                <p>When looking for design inspiration or different crafts to do on the weekend, I often find myself on Pinterest. According to Bill DeRouchey's design principles, Pinterest's site works effectively. There is a clear hierarchy of different elements. At the top you have a clear search bar. Nested underneath you have the different tabs you can pick to narrow down the search. However, these tabs are very friendly, inviting, and iconic, making the website easy to manage. Underneath these tabs are the actual results which are organized in columns and rows. This layout follows DeRouchey's guidelines of the interface communicated with the audience effectively. There is clarity. There is simplicity. The words, icons, and colors all interact effectively together, creating an effective an informative design. Because I use this site all the time it makes viewing everything simple and easy, almost relazing. </p>

            <h3>Evaluating an Interface | 1.7.2016</h3>
                <p>I use my MacPro for around 6 hours a day, mostly consisting of classwork and homework. At any given time, GoogleChrome, an Adobe program, or Brackets, is running (expect the rare occasions I might actually turn my computer off.) One of the best features of Apple products, specially the MacPro interface, is the simplicity. Each app logo is clean and clear, nicely situated at the bottom or side of your screen, either visible or hidden. The user is allowed to change icons, customizing even the home dashboard to their liking by simply dragging and dropping. The simplicity allows effective communication between the user and the interface, which adds to the products overall appeal. Despite there being a millions different options and settings for the computer, the design makes it feel like there are only a few to choose from, allowing the user to never feels overwhelmed. Overall the MacProâ€™s ability to simplify and condense an abundance of information and display it in a clean, effective manner proves its dominance as a great interface. </p> </h4>
