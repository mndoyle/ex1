            <h3>Evaluating an Interface | 1.7.2016</h3>
                <p>I use my MacPro for around 6 hours a day, mostly consisting of classwork and homework. At any given time, GoogleChrome, an Adobe program, or Brackets, is running (expect the rare occasions I might actually turn my computer off.) One of the best features of Apple products, specially the MacPro interface, is the simplicity. Each app logo is clean and clear, nicely situated at the bottom or side of your screen, either visible or hidden. The user is allowed to change icons, customizing even the home dashboard to their liking by simply dragging and dropping. The simplicity allows effective communication between the user and the interface, which adds to the products overall appeal. Despite there being a millions different options and settings for the computer, the design makes it feel like there are only a few to choose from, allowing the user to never feels overwhelmed. Overall the MacProâ€™s ability to simplify and condense an abundance of information and display it in a clean, effective manner proves its dominance as a great interface. </p> </h4>
